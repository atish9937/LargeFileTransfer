        <h1>About LargeFileTransfer.org - The Future of Large File Transfer</h1>

        <h2>Why We Created LargeFileTransfer.org</h2>
        <p>LargeFileTransfer.org was born out of frustration with the existing file sharing landscape. Like many of you, we constantly faced the dreaded "file too large" error when trying to email important documents, videos, or project files. We watched as colleagues struggled to share work files across teams, freelancers waited hours for uploads to complete, and families gave up trying to share vacation photos because they exceeded arbitrary size limits.</p>

        <p>But the real breaking point came when we realized the privacy implications of traditional file sharing services. Every time you upload a file to a cloud service, you're trusting that company with your data. Your files sit on their servers—sometimes for weeks—vulnerable to data breaches, unauthorized access, or even company policies that claim rights to scan your content. For sensitive business documents, confidential legal files, or personal data, this simply wasn't acceptable.</p>

        <p>We asked ourselves: <strong>Why should sending a file be any different from having a private conversation?</strong> When you talk to someone in person, your words don't pass through a third party. So why should your files?</p>

        <h2>Our Mission: Privacy-First File Sharing for Everyone</h2>
        <p>LargeFileTransfer.org was built on three core principles:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Privacy is a right, not a feature.</strong> Your files should never touch our servers or anyone else's. Period.</li>
            <li><strong>File size shouldn't dictate how you work.</strong> Whether it's a 5MB document or a 10GB video project, you should be able to share it freely.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplicity matters.</strong> No accounts, no subscriptions, no complicated setups. Just share and go.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We believe that secure file transfer shouldn't require a computer science degree or a monthly subscription. It should be as simple as sending a link, as fast as a direct connection allows, and as private as a face-to-face conversation.</p>

        <h2>The Problem We're Solving</h2>
        <p>Traditional file sharing methods all have significant drawbacks:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email:</strong> Limited to 20-25MB, which barely covers a few photos or a short video</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud storage services:</strong> Require uploads, storage management, and often paid subscriptions for large files</li>
            <li><strong>Traditional file transfer sites:</strong> Store your files on their servers, creating privacy risks and slow transfer speeds</li>
            <li><strong>USB drives:</strong> Require physical proximity and can be lost or stolen</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each of these solutions asks you to compromise on speed, privacy, convenience, or all three. We refused to accept that compromise.</p>

        <h2>Our Solution: True Peer-to-Peer Technology</h2>
        <p>LargeFileTransfer.org leverages cutting-edge WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology to establish direct, encrypted connections between your device and your recipient's device. This means:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your files never touch our servers.</strong> They go directly from you to your recipient, encrypted end-to-end.</li>
            <li><strong>Transfer speeds are limited only by your internet connection</strong>—not by server upload/download queues.</li>
            <li><strong>No storage limits or file quotas.</strong> We don't store your files, so we don't need to limit them.</li>
            <li><strong>No accounts or tracking.</strong> We don't need to know who you are or what you're sharing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Choose LargeFileTransfer.org?</h2>

        <h3>Complete Privacy</h3>
        <p>Files transfer directly between devices with military-grade end-to-end encryption. Your data never passes through our servers, meaning we couldn't access your files even if we wanted to. What you share stays between you and your recipient.</p>

        <h3>No File Size Limits</h3>
        <p>Send files up to 10GB without restrictions, subscriptions, or hidden fees. Whether you're sharing a multi-gigabyte video project or hundreds of high-resolution photos, we've got you covered.</p>

        <h3>Lightning-Fast Transfers</h3>
        <p>Because files transfer directly between devices, speeds are limited only by your internet connection—not server bandwidth. P2P connections are typically 2-3x faster than traditional cloud upload/download cycles.</p>

        <h3>Zero Registration Required</h3>
        <p>No sign-ups, no email verification, no password to remember. Generate a link and start sharing immediately. We believe file sharing should be instant and effortless.</p>

        <h3>Open Source & Transparent</h3>
        <p>We believe in transparency. Our technology is based on open web standards (WebRTC), and we're committed to being clear about exactly how your files are transferred and protected.</p>
